# Faun Forum

Faun is a simple directory-based forum and asset catalog engine for small communities.
It is a self-hosting solution which can run locally or in any server environment without
any hussle: no databases etc are required. Its web app doesn't use any javascript or
cookies.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add faun

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install faun

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. 
You can also run `bin/faun` for an command-line tool and `bin/faund` to run a web server.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new 
version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, 
which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the
`.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
